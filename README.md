# About

This is a Google apps script that uses the free DarkSky API to get weather information, print it on Google Spreadsheets and send a notification to a Chatwork chat room.

This bot was developed to work with a specific Google spreadsheet that has information regarding the chatroom and the message to be sent, so it doesn't work as a service at the moment. In the future, I'm aiming to make it work without using a spreadsheet.
